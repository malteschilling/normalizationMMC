# normalizationMMC
Implementation of a functional internal body model that is based on the Mean of Multiple Computation principle in Python. The model is completely realized in a recurrent neural network as necessary normalization steps are integrated into the neural model itself. Furthermore, a dynamic extension is applied to the model.
